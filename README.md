### Objective of the project

* To automatically detect how closely relaated the books written by charles Darwin are to each other

### Methods Used

* Content based recommendation system
* Data Visualization
* Machine learning
* Data Manipulation
* Statistics and probability

### Technologies used

* `Pandas`
* `re`
* `seaborn`
* `matplotlib`
* `nltk`
* `gensim`

### Project Description

The dataset fro the project was manually collected from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) by DataCamp. Recommedation systems are used accross various industries e.g AMazon and netflix. In this project i built a book recommendation system based on the content of the books written by charles darwin.To this purpose a content-based recommedation system was used to build our book recommendation system.
