# Books Recommendation System From Charles Darwin's Published books
This system was created based on books written by Charles Darwin.

## About Charles Darwin and this project
Charles dawin is known as the *Father of evolution* because he gave the theory of natural selection and established that the current species of organisms have all originated from common ancestral species. His most renowned work is without a doubt his `On the Origin of Species` published in 1859 which introduced the concept of natural selection. Darwin wrote oher books on several other topics such as plants,geography and his personal life.
- In this notebook I analyzed how closely related Darwin's books are to each other,especially books similar to his famous book `Origin of Species`

## Project intro/Objectivies
To this purpose, we will develop the bases of a content-based book recommendation system, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are. The methods we will use are commonly used in text- or documents-heavy industries such as legal, tech or customer support to perform some common task such as text classification or handling search engine queries.
